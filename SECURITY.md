The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Developer Name            | Email                       | GPG Fingerprint                                    |

You can import a key by running the following command with that
individual’s fingerprint: `gpg --recv-keys "<fingerprint>"`
Ensure that you put quotes around fingerprints containing spaces.

The public key can also be found in the Electrum git repository,
in the top-level `pubkeys` folder.
